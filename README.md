# Experiments with ORB-SLAM3 and emscripten 

Experiments to attempt to get [ORB-SLAM3](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3) working with emscripten.

Please use [the binvoc branch of my own fork of ORB-SLAM3](https://github.com/nickw1/ORB_SLAM3/tree/binvoc)

Using binary vocabulary file, now loads in 2s compared to more than 10 minutes :-)

Got ORB loading. Things to note:

- the `.data` file generated by emscripten needs to be copied from the `wasm` directory to the project root. There's probably some configuration which needs to be done here but this is on the todo list.

- note the security settings for the headers in `.htaccess`. These are necessary to allow `SharedArrayBuffer`, which is necessary for threading.
