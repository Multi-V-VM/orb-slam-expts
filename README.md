# Experiments with ORB-SLAM3 and emscripten 

Experiments to attempt to get [ORB-SLAM3](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3) working with emscripten.

Please use [the binvoc branch of my own fork of ORB-SLAM3](https://github.com/nickw1/ORB_SLAM3/tree/binvoc)

Now starting to get tracking working. Added log messages to ORB-SLAM3 fork to identify causes of initialisation failure. Had to remove the time interval check win `Tracking::Track()` - not sure what impact that has. When two views are obtained, currently an unaligned memory access error occurs. Not sure of the cause of this at present.

Using binary vocabulary file, now loads in 2s compared to more than 10 minutes :-)

Got ORB loading. Things to note:

- the `.data` file generated by emscripten needs to be copied from the `wasm` directory to the project root. This can probably be fixed with some configuration but this is on the todo list.

- note the security settings for the headers in `.htaccess`. These are necessary to allow `SharedArrayBuffer`, which is necessary for threading.
